'''
Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age?")
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

age = int(age)
years_left = 90 - age
months_left = years_left * 12
weeks_left = years_left * 52
days_left = years_left * 365

print(f"You have {years_left} years, {months_left} months, {weeks_left} weeks and {days_left} days left.")
