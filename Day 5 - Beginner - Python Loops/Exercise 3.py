'''
You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100, including 1 and 100.
e.g. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100
Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.
'''

#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

total = 0
for i in range(1,101):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        total += i
print('Sum of even numbers from 1-100 is:',total)
