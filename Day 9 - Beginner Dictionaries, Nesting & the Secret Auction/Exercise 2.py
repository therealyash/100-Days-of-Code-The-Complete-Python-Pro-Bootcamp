'''
You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log. You can see a travel_log which is a List that contains 2 Dictionaries.
Write a function that will work with the following line of code on line 21 to add the entry for Russia to the travel_log.
add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])
add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])
You've visited Russia 2 times.
You've been to Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
DO NOT modify the travel_log directly. You need to create a function that modifies it.
